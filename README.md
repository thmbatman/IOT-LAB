Welcome to the IoT Lab – where YAML files and configurations come together like peanut butter and jelly... 

if peanut butter could connect to Wi-Fi and jelly could communicate with sensors.

In this glorious repository, you'll find everything you need to make your IoT experiments work (or at least pretend they do).

Credits:

AM – for making sure this repository is more functional than your grandma's old toaster.


NS – for ensuring the sensors don’t just sit there and complain about their connection.
